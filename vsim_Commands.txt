Issues:
Certain errors can be fixed by deleting the work file. If your design can't compile try this.
In the directory where you run your *.d0 file, if no work file exists, one is generated when
you run the commands above. Delete this folder. It won't break anything. The .do file deletes
everytime it runs and the file is already there.

Schematic won't load:
    Delete the debug file, vsim.dbg
